# OS筆記書 (OtomeSound's Note)

Just writting a story maybe you haven't listen before.

(只是一個你未曾體驗過的故事，但一直在我腦海裡浮動)

## 簡介 (Introduction)

以紀錄作者在Blacken_Angel世界的思想為主

你可以視其為一本小說，散文，或是胡謅的亂文筆記本為主

但我寫不出過於虛假的事物，裡頭的故事就像是腦海裡歷練過的事物

只為了滿足個人想要寫故事的心願而已

It's written in chinese, but I'll try to it properly for somebody  to listen the meanings they want to get.

Maybe some non-Chinese listener use google translate to get English version, but I don't care, just reading.

I'm not good at fabricating story, so these story may have occured at my thought, and this book is just I want to meet the aspiration.
